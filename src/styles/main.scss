    modules

    The modules directory is reserved for Sass code that doesn't cause Sass to actually output CSS. 
    Things like mixin declarations, functions, and variables.

/*
    partials

    The partials directory is where the meat of my CSS is constructed. 
    A lot of folks like to break their stylesheets into header, content, sidebar, and footer components 
    (and a few others). As I'm more of a SMACSS guy myself, I like to break things down into 
    much finer categories (typography, buttons, textboxes, selectboxes, etcâ€¦).
